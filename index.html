        <p>Ashley has many goals in life. One in particular is going to Japan. Ashley had almost accomplished this goal back in 2020 for her honeymoon after her wedding, however, Covid happened and restricted flights into Japan. She still hopes to make it there one day, sooner rather than later.</p>

        <p>An accomplishment that Ashley has made is getting married. This may seem like a silly "accomplishment" to some but to Ashley it meant the world to her to get married. She had always looked forward to getting married one day and she married her best friend. She is proud to call herself a wife and they are going on 5 years strong.</p>
