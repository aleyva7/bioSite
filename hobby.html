<p>Ashley has many hobbies as she likes to stay busy.</p>
<p>One of her hobbies includes watching anime shows religiously. I consider this a hobby because it plays into her other hobbies. Her preferred website to watch them is crunchyroll (LINK). She has a lot of different shows and movies in her library.</p>
<p>Watching anime helps with her hobby of cosplaying. This is dressing up like animated characters and going to comic conventions as that character. Not only does she like dressing up, but she will make all her costumes from scratch by hand! She even does it for her husband so they can go as a pair to these conventions.</p>
<p>Another hobby is she likes to create little trinkets. She has a store where she sells items she makes with her 3D printer and by hand. She made these snow globes of Pok√©mon characters that she is proud of. Her imagination is indescribable. </p>
